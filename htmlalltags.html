        <p>"hen we look at the webpage, we see that there are few spaces added before and after a paragraph. HTML does this by default.look at a few properties of the paragraph tag: 

            As already mentioned, the tag automatically adds space before and after any paragraph, which is basically margins added by the browser<br>
            If a user adds multiple spaces, the browser reduces them to a single space.<br>
            If a user adds multiple lines, the browser reduces them to a single line.<br>
            By default, the display of the Paragraph element is set to “block” which you can change using CSS. This means that if you add another paragraph to the webpage the next paragraph will be inserted in the next line on the webpage."</p>
